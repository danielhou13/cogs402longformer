He has two biological sisters aged 16 and 5. He has a past psychiatric history of persistent depressive disorder, unspecified depressive disorder, ADHD and significant polysubstance use (marijuana, nicotine, cocaine, amphetamines, opioids, alcohol). In the community, he is followed by the Provincial Concurrent Disorders Program, which includes Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7**], Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 14**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7**] and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 8**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 15**] (CYMH counselor). He is connected to the DEWY Day Program and has a private substance use disorder counsellor, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 11**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8**], in the community. He is connected with a CYMH Outreach Worker, [**Last Name (un) 13**], through Tricities Mental Health. He is enrolled an online school program, completing grade 11 course work.  He has a girlfriend, [**Name (NI) 16**], in the community. He does not have any children. He enjoys hockey, and golf. 

[**Last Name (un) **] was brought to hospital by EMS on [**2020-06-01**] under section 28. Police were called by his mother, [**Name (NI) 3**], after [**Last Name (un) **] told her he wanted to "take drugs and not wake up". He was acutely intoxicated upon arrival in the emergency department and was unable to provide a reliable history. [**Male First Name (un) 3**] reported [**Last Name (un) **] had left Creekside Detox Facility against medical advice earlier in the day. Based on collateral documentation [**Last Name (un) **] had ingested cocaine, MDMA, Xanax, and bath salts after leaving Creekside. 

Initially, on presentation to the emergency department, [**Last Name (un) **] was able to ambulate but became sedated shortly after arrival. Preliminary investigations demonstrated an elevated Acteaminophen level, with no corresponding increase in liver enzymes. Poison Control was consulted for possible acetaminophen overdose, and the NAC protocol was initiated. Pediatrics was consulted, and [**Last Name (un) 2**] was admitted to the Clinical Teaching Unit (CTU) for ongoing treatment and assessment. Fortunately, [**Last Name (un) 2**] was asymptomatic with respect to his Tylenol overdose/ingestion. He was medically cleared after receiving the NAC protocol on [**2020-06-02**]. He was transferred to the CAPE unit under the care of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 17**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 18**] for ongoing psychiatric assessment. 


[**Last Name (un) **] reported a longstanding history of depressive symptoms and anxiety while admitted to CAPE, dating back at least 2 years time. He described experiencing a number of substantial loses from [**2009**] to present which have contributed to these symptoms. These include: witnessing his mother experience significant complications and admission to hospital following abdominal surgery (2007); biological father dying from fentanyl overdose (2004); acute loss of grandfather from myocardial infarction (2016). Most notably are the losses of [**Last Name (un) 1**] father and grandfather. [**Name (NI) **] was beginning to establish a relationship with his father around the time of his death and this represented a significant loss to him. Additionally, [**Last Name (un) 1**] grandfather served a role model and parental figure for [**Last Name (un) **] for much of his life. The loss of his grandfather was a substantial loss for both [**Last Name (un) **] and his family. While in hospital, [**Last Name (un) **] reported that his mood been on average a "[**01-05**]" prior to hospital. He denied ongoing suicidal ideation, intent, or active suicidal plans. He reported that he had only threatened to end his life prior to admission because he was "high and did want to return to rehab." [**Last Name (un) **] also reported that he only feels suicidal when he uses drugs, and recognized that this was a pattern for him. [**Last Name (un) 2**] reported that this suicidal threat was insincere and not something that he intended to act on. He reported wanting to live for his girlfriend, [**Name (NI) 16**], and family. He also reported living for his job at a local golf course. [**Last Name (un) 1**] reported no change in his appetite, or energy level prior to admission. He denies any restrictive intake behaviors and has not experienced any weight change. He reported sleep disturbance, which is likely complicated by active substance use. He did not report any thoughts/feeling of guilt and/or hopelessness.

[**Last Name (un) 1**] substance use is an active component of his current presentation. Collateral history from [**Male First Name (un) 3**] indicates it has been difficult to engage him in substance use related treatment and follow-up in the community despite several community support in place. Understandably, [**Male First Name (un) 3**] is concerned about [**Last Name (un) 1**] substance use worsening and the possibility that he will die from an overdose. She reports that he has stolen from both her and his grandmother to support his drug use. She reports there have been concerns from [**Last Name (un) 1**] employer about his behavior at work and that he has been using on the job. [**Male First Name (un) 3**] also reports that [**Last Name (un) **] has not been willing to attend residential treatment despite the families persistent encouragement. 

In hospital, [**Last Name (un) **] was found to be precontemplative with regard to his substance use. He seems to appreciate the significant risks associated with his substance use, but is inconsistent in his willingness/motivation to address this pattern of behavior. In consultation with his community team, [**Last Name (un) **] was referred to the residential [**Location (un) 4**] Substance Use Program. Unfortunately, [**Last Name (un) **] was not accepted into this program as he fell outside of the programs cachement. [**Last Name (un) **] was offered an admission to the BCCH inpatient adolescent psychiatry unit (P2) for ongoing treatment of his concurrent substance use and psychiatric diagnoses. Despite numerous attempts to engage [**Last Name (un) 2**] with this option for an inpatient admission [**Last Name (un) 2**] decline admission. [**Last Name (un) **] was willing to engage outpatient follow-up including: attending appointments with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7**] and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 8**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 19**] through the Concurrent Disorders Program; attending appointments with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 11**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8**]; attending the Dewy Day program; attending NA meetings with [**Male First Name (un) 3**]. He is also agreeable to follow up with his youth outreach worker, [**Last Name (un) 13**], from the tri-cities mental health team whom he has a strong alliance with in the community. 

On the unit [**Last Name (un) **] remained settled. There were not significant behavioral/safety concerns noted. He communicated and engaged with staff appropriately. He did not use substance while in hospital. He had several passes with family off the CAPE Unit prior to discharge that went well without any significant concerns. 

While in hospital, [**Last Name (un) **] and [**Male First Name (un) 3**], received psychoeducation about concurrent psychiatric and substance use disorders.  A number of harm reduction interventions occurred while in hospital including: naloxone training, medical work-up for IVDU related infectious disease; and medication change to reduce prescription misuse/diversion. Both [**Male First Name (un) 3**] and [**Last Name (un) **] received Naloxone training in hospital, and were provided with a Naloxone kits. [**Last Name (un) 20**] infectious serology for HCV, HBV, HIV and syphilis were negative. [**Last Name (un) 20**] ADHD medication was changed in hospital to further reduce the risk of diversion/misuse. 

Prior to his discharge from hospital, a family meeting was held to review disposition planning. We discussed the available community supports and plan for ongoing follow-up with [**Male First Name (un) 3**] and [**Last Name (un) 2**]. [**Male First Name (un) 3**] was disappointed that [**Last Name (un) **] was not accepted to residential treatment. The rationale for the referral being refused, and other available options was also discussed. It was also determined that [**Last Name (un) 2**] would live with his grandmother outside of hospital, but with conditions that he would agreed to ongoing followup and supports in the community as well as a number of new limitations within the household (no vehicle use/cellphone use; supervised visits with girlfriend). The limitations were discussed with [**Last Name (un) **] prior to discharge and he was seemingly agreeable. A prescription for new medications was also provided to the family. Following the meeting, [**Last Name (un) **] was discharged from hospital.

Thank you for the opportunity to be involved in [**Last Name (un) 1**] care. Please do not hesitate to contact us directly if you have any questions and/or concerns regarding his admission to hospital.
