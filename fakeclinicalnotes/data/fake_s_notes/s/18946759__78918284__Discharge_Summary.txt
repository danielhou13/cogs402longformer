WORKING DSM-V DIAGNOSES
1.	Borderline personality traits versus disorder, 301.83 (we have discussed that given [**Location (un) 3**] age as well as seeing him during a time of crisis, it is not appropriate to give him a full diagnosis of borderline personality disorder).
2.	Unspecified depressive disorder, 311.
3.	His unspecified anxiety disorder, 300.
4.	Cannabis use disorder, mild, 305.20.
5.	Parent-child relational problem, 361.20.
6.	Intellectual disability, psychoeducation test conducted in spring of [**2020**] (written language output disorder, arithmetic disorder, and a writing output disorder).

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE
1.	Fluoxetine 20 mg p.o. q.a.m.  Please note that we have changed the dosing to morning dosing, as evening dosing can be quite agitating and may have interrupted in [**Location (un) 3**] sleep pattern.  He was given a 1-month supply with no repeats.
2.	Lorazepam sublingual 0.5 to 1 mg q.4h p.r.n. to a maximum of 4 mg in 24 hours.  We have given him a prescription of 30 tablets with no repeats.  The family is aware to use this as part of his safety planning and acute distress episodes, especially in the first month after discharge.
3.	Trazodone 25 mg p.o. nightly for initial and mid insomnia.  Given for a 1-month supply with no repeats.
4.	Melatonin 3 to 15 mg p.o. nightly 30 minutes before bedtime over-the-counter.

THERAPEUTIC RECOMMENDATIONS UPON DISCHARGE
1.	Safety planning:  We have gone over explanation of safety planning with both [**Location (un) **] individually as well as with both parents during the discharge meeting today.  We have also filled out [**Signature 1**] form which was done in the emergency department, where he rates as low suicide risk.  [**Location (un) **] is actually very insightful and displays good judgment and is able to ask for help when he is feeling distraught.  Although he had a recent overdose of "20 tablets of ibuprofen" in the context of altercation at band camp in Whistler 48 hours ago, there was very vague evidence of the same.  It is important to note that his ongoing suicidal thinking behaviors as well as gestures are very important to take in the context of [**Location (un) 3**] overall level of distress.  It should also be noted that he is quite aware that he has "maladaptive coping" and at times may escalate from 0 to 100 without any clear psychosocial stressors or reasoning.  We have gone over a behavioral approach with safety planning, and we have also encouraged the family to discuss the safety plan with [**Location (un) **] upon discharge in the next week.  This will also give the family language to discuss safety as well as "overwhelming feelings" for [**Location (un) **].  We have given them a handout on behavioral strategies.  We have also gone over a few behavioral strategies which would include creating a "safe place" for [**Location (un) **] to go when he is being disrespectful towards his family or self-deprecating towards himself and has urges of self-injurious behaviors.  We have also discussed deescalation strategies for the parents to use in order to provide some level of role modeling for [**Location (un) **].  We have discussed that when [**Location (un) **] is feeling overwhelmed that his overall organization of feelings and expression of affect, it is very difficult for him to communicate, given that his "prefrontal cortex is being highjacked."  The family clearly understands this and understands that it will require practice on both [**Location (un) **] as well as the family, but they are willing to refine and work through the safety planning as needed.  They are also aware that if they are in a moment of crisis, and they have gone through the safety plan as well as using any deescalation techniques, such as lorazepam sublingually, and they are unable to deescalate the situation to present to [**Hospital 4**] [**Hospital 5**] for additional crisis management.  At this time, [**Location (un) **] does not meet criteria under the Mental Health Act and is safe for discharge.  Please note that he has a history of chronic suicidal ideation and actually does have some coping mechanisms which he can access, including deep breathing, mindfulness techniques, as well as challenging some of his cognitive distortions, which were discussed on this CAPE stay.  
2.	Biological.  We have given him a prescription, as noted above, with discharge medications.  The only change that we did make was that his dosing of Prozac should be now in the morning, as nighttime dosing may lead to further agitation and interrupted sleep pattern.  We have discontinued the Seroquel 25 mg p.o. at bedtime, as this is not a very safe choice for a young youth, given the potential metabolic side effects (i.e. weight gain, abnormal fasting blood work).  Instead, we have gone over trazodone as a good alternative to use to help with sleep; however, we still would encourage overall behavioral approaches, such as sleep hygiene as well as higher doses of melatonin ranging from 12 to 15 mg 30 minutes before bedtime.  
3.	Psychological interventions:  The bulk majority of our time, in terms of formulating [**Location (un) **] as well as during our discharge interview, was around what psychological avenue would best suit [**Location (un) 3**] needs at this time.  At this time, he is currently seeing [**Signature 1**] , who is part of the high-risk mental health team in [**Location (un) 4**] for the past 2 months.  Although this has been very supportive in nature and quite beneficial for [**Location (un) **] as well as the family to ensure some level of clinical stability, we have discussed that [**Location (un) 3**] needs are likely beyond supportive and insight-oriented therapy.  At this time, he is currently positively engaging in group therapy for anxiety disorders, which we encouraged him to continue, as he is able to feel supported by the community team.  Our social worker, [**Last Name (un) 6**] [**Last Name (un) 7**], has discussed with [**Female First Name (un) 8**] that moving forward, likely a child and youth mental health team approach would be best beneficial. 

We have specifically discussed that even though [**Location (un) **] is 13 years of age, that he certainly is displaying maladaptive coping habits or mechanisms in the context of a borderline personality structure.  We specifically have advocated for not only one-to-one therapy around important practices around borderline treatment, but we have also encouraged the family to think about family therapy in the future.  Although it was a tenuous discharge meeting, the family really did understand how complex the borderline personality structure is and that it requires very specific treatment, such as dialectical behavioral therapy.  Although we are not aware of what is available in terms of resources on [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9**], we have encouraged the family to continue to advocate around getting services for [**Location (un) **] as well as the family.  For example, working with a therapist specifically around mindfulness techniques as well as regulation responses as well as identifying emotions could be a great starting point for one-to-one therapy for [**Location (un) **].  In addition, mobilizing other supports for the family is essential in this treatment plan, as the family needs to further have a deeper understanding of borderline personality but also work around the behavioral coping mechanisms and support that they need moving forward.
1.	At this time, we do not feel that cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, or mobilizing any manualized type of therapy would be beneficial for [**Location (un) **].  He really requires validation of this hospital stay as well as the strife that he is feeling, even though if it feels "behavioral" to the family.  The family certainly intellectually understands the complexities now of the borderline pathology, especially in the context of adoption, history of attachment which continues with biological mother.  We also feel that the family would benefit from learning more about attachment in the context of having an adopted child and how to manage some of these distressing behaviors, which is clearly affecting not only [**Location (un) **] on an individual basis but the entire family interpersonally. 

We would certainly advocate for social work to be involved in this multidisciplinary team approach, as the family would require support and education during the treatment journey of this child.  
1.	Social history:  We are in support of him starting his job at McDonald's in the next few months as a way of not only organizing his time but also gaining some level of skills and autonomy.  We also encouraged him to continue with his hobbies, which include music, and potentially to pursue perhaps summer camps that would nurture some of his innate talents as well as abilities.  We also encourage him to lead a healthy lifestyle, which would include not only good sleep hygiene but also a healthy balanced nutrition and 30 minutes of exercise on a daily basis at least 5 times a week.  The social and healthy lifestyle changes can be gradual, and for further information, they can access the [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10**] [**Last Name (un) 11**] Mental Health workbook to healthy lifestyles and behaviors.
2.	School accommodations:  [**Last Name (un) 6**] [**Last Name (un) 7**], our CAPE social worker, will be in touch with the school on Monday.  We are aware of the psychoeducation test and some of the learning challenges that [**Location (un) **] is displaying.  From our understanding, he does have a solid IEP in place; however, we would like to further advocate for [**Location (un) 3**] needs, which are likely more emotional, and some of the interpersonal conflict that he may have upon return to school.  We are very aware that he is a bright individual; however, the school stress is absolutely important in order for us to fully formulate some of [**Location (un) 3**] distress outside of the family unit.  In addition, his social abilities and his intense relationship with peers and overall fear of abandonment are very important for the school to understand, as well, moving forward.
3.	Community followup:  We recommend that [**Location (un) **] follows up with his family doctor in the next 2 weeks just to oversee how the medications are going as well as how the family is responding to the community child youth mental health recommendations.  We also have followed up with [**Female First Name (un) 8**], who will coordinate the referral to the Child and Youth Mental Health team in [**Location (un) 4**].  We encouraged the family to contact [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 6**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7**] in case that there are missing links upon discharge and/or difficulties accessing the child and youth team in [**Location (un) 4**].  
4.	Reason for referral in the emergency department:  The emergency physician referred [**Name9 (PRE) **] after 20-tablet ingestion of ibuprofen in the context of an altercation at band camp in Whistler.  This was in the context of him bringing in alcohol, despite knowing the rules, and him reacting to the "consequences."  This was for diagnostic profiling and treatment options.
5.	Status while on the Cape unit:  [**Location (un) **] was admitted for a 24-hour stay in the context of parent-child conflict and increased suicidal ideation.  This was an important admission for not only [**Location (un) **] but as well as the family to clarify the diagnoses that are likely affecting this youth and feeling constantly "invalidated" or dismissed for his mental health concerns. 

When [**Location (un) **] was assessed in the emergency department, he had an overall feeling of being overwhelmed and wanting to be in the hospital in order for his parents to "understand what I'm going through finally).  While he was on the CAPE unit, he was very cooperative as well as asking very good questions when they it to diagnosis and his medication changes. 

We had given him psychoeducation materials while on the CAPE unit prior to his discharge to look over and to ask us if he requires any additional information around borderline personality disorder.  He agrees that he is quite black-and-white and that he can escalate and that sometimes it probably feels like "walking on eggshells for his parents."  At the same time, [**Location (un) **] was not in the space to receive a lot of information on this stay.  We created it to be a an overall validating experience for him in order to gain some buy in with mental health professionals.  [**Location (un) **] admitted that he felt heard, but it was not until his parents came for the discharge meeting that he clearly escalated. 

During that time, 1 hour before the discharge meeting, he called the parents and quickly relayed to staff that he feels overall that his parents "don't care" and that the reason he is in hospital is all "his fault."  We specifically brought this information up during the family meeting to discuss the dissonance of what [**Location (un) **] feels and what he hears or what is communicated to him.  The family then understood that focusing more on [**Location (un) 3**] experience versus discussing the details of "what was said and what was not said" is much more important at this time to ensure that [**Location (un) **] feels heard by his family. 

During our discharge meeting, we not only went over the therapeutic plan, but [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 6**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7**] also went over many different types of behavioral strategies to help the family navigate this type of complex picture. 

We also discussed substance use disorders and how although this can be higher in youth that have underlying mental health diagnosis, such as depression, anxiety, or borderline personality, that he has good judgment to know that he is currently using cannabis and alcohol as a means of "maladaptive coping."  He has all of the information intellectually from both his family as well as from the community team.  He does not feel that he has a "substance use problem" at this time, and with the use that he is discussing with us, we felt that he did not require concurrent disorders referral at this time.  In the future, however, if he continues to experiment, or his usage increases in the context of interpersonal stressors, the community team should certainly look at a concurrent disorder referral and potentially use a motivational interviewing modality. 

At this time, we are aware that we have shifted the diagnosis for community providers to start thinking of this in a more complex personality structure but also that the symptoms of anxiety, panic attacks, and depressive symptoms are certainly still present cross sectionally. 

Thank you for this complex referral.  We hope that the family feels supported and heard upon this discharge; however, we understand that there may be more questions or concerns that come out of this discharge in the next while, and we are happy to either talk to the healthcare professionals as well as the family should they have any immediate concerns. 

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned.
